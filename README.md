# PPHPC: a spatial agent-based model for benchmarking

#### What does PPHPC mean?

Predator-Prey for High-Performance Computing

#### What is the purpose of this model?

It's a spatial agent-based model (sABM) clearly defined using the 
[ODD](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380006002043) 
protocol, so that it's possible to implement the model unambiguously 
on different platforms, processors or operating system, and using
different approaches. This way, it becomes possible to directly compare
and evaluate these different implementations. The comparison results can 
then aid in the decision of what paths to follow when implementing
other large-scale sABMs.

#### Currently available implementations

* Netlogo
* Java (single-thread, multi-thread)
* More to come soon

#### Publications

* Fachada, N., Lopes, V.V., Martins, R.C., Rosa, A.C., 
PPHPC: A model for benchmarking spatial agent-based
simulations, currently unpublished

#### Licenses

Several Open Source licenses, which depend on the
implementation.
